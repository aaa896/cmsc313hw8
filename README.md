PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE:
Test difference in c/c++ code by calculating a matrix equation 

FILES: 
b.bat           builds on windows with cl  
r.bat           runs on windows from b.bat build  
r.sh            compiles and runs with gcc  
c_matrix.c      example c matrix code  
cpp_matrix.cpp  example c++ matrix code  

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:  
run b.bat and r.bat on windows. Can use developer prompt if not set up.  
run r.sh shell script for linux after chmod +x. dos2unix may be needed on r.sh  

TESTING METHODOLOGY:  
i printed and checked the output  

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  
output is the printed equation solved, r files run both c and c ++ versions
